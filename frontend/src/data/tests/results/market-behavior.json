          "en": "At the EXCELLENT level, you see the market's emotional cycles before most traders even notice them. You recognize that weakness is often the signal of future strength, and strength is often the signal of future slowing. Instead of trusting headlines, you trust repeated patterns: multiple lows tend to bounce, multiple highs tend to fade, fear signals opportunity, and excitement signals caution. Your awareness becomes more than observation—it becomes timing. You stop believing the market is chaotic and start seeing its consistent behavior across decades. This shift lets you anticipate movement with a calm mind and a sharper eye.\n\nPractical Move: Each morning, label the market as \"emotional strength\" or \"emotional weakness\" instead of \"up\" or \"down.\"\n\nWhat will you earn: Clarity that removes confusion and accelerates timing accuracy.\n\nFun Fact: Some of the strongest weekly rallies came right after the worst market breadth days.",

          "en": "You learn what traps pull traders into bad decisions. Strong advances feel like promises of more gains, but history shows they often fail. Big drops feel like danger, but they often signal recovery. Understanding these hooks protects you from emotional bait. You begin to see patterns in how news, headlines, and social media exaggerate market moves. The stronger the story, the less reliable the signal usually is. This level helps you detach from external noise and focus on behavioral truth.\n\nPractical Move: Whenever news is overly positive or negative, check if the market already moved before reacting.\n\nWhat will you earn: Protection from common psychological traps.\n\nFun Fact: Most \"breakout hype\" fades within days.",

When it drops several days, the rhythm bends upward.
